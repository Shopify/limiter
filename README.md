# Limiter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/limiter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/limiter)

This gem implements a simple mechanism to throttle or rate-limit operations in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-limiter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-limiter

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To rate limit calling an instance method, a mixin is provided. Simply specify the method to be limited, and the maximum
rate that the method can be called. This rate is (by default) a number of requests per minute.

``` ruby
class Widget
  extend Limiter::Mixin

  # limit the rate we can call tick to 300 times per minute
  # when the rate has been exceeded, a call to tick will block until the rate limit would not be exceeded
  limit_method :tick, rate: 300

  ...
end
```

To specify the rate in terms of an interval shorter (or longer) than 1 minute, an optional `interval` parameter can be
provided to specify the throttling period in seconds.

``` ruby
class Widget
  extend Limiter::Mixin

  # limit the rate we can call tick to 5 times per second
  # when the rate has been exceeded, a call to tick will block until the rate limit would not be exceeded
  # and the provided block will be executed
  limit_method(:tick, rate: 5, interval: 1) do
    puts 'Limit reached'
  end

  ...
end
```

#### Load balancing

By default all calls to the `limit_method` will be bursted, e.g. as quick as possible, until the rate is exceeded.
Then we wait for the remainder of the interval to continue. To even out the burst, an optional `balanced` parameter can be
provided to enable interleaving between the method calls, e.g: `interleave = interval / size`.

``` ruby
  ...
  limit_method :tick, rate: 60, balanced: true
  ...
```

For example: with an interval of 60 seconds and a rate of 60:

`balanced: false`
: As quickly as possible we call the method 60 times, then we wait for the remainder of the time.

`balanced: true`
: We interleave each call with 1 second so we call this method every second.


### Advanced Usage

In cases where the mixin is not appropriate the `RateQueue` class can be used directly. As in the mixin examples above,
the `interval` parameter is optional (and defaults to 1 minute). It is also possible
to provide the block to `RateQueue`, which will be executed on each limit hit (useful for metrics).

``` ruby
class Widget
  def initialize
    # create a rate-limited queue which allows 10000 operations per hour
    @queue = Limiter::RateQueue.new(10000, interval: 3600) do
      puts "Hit the limit, waiting"
    end
  end

  def tick
    # this operation will block until less than 10000 shift calls have been made within the last hour
    @queue.shift
    # do something
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
